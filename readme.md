# Request / Response MVC!

* Fork this repo
* Clone this repo
* Create your controllers in `app/controllers`
  * Make sure they all inherit from `ApplicationController`
* Create your routes in `config/router.rb`
* Test out all the routes from the assignment using Postman
* All responses should be in JSON format.


* Run the server with `ruby bin/server.rb`
  * Please note: The server will need to be restarted every time you change your code.
* The server file _should_ be loading all your files in `app/controllers` and `app/models`. It has also loaded `pry` and `json` for you.
